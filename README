unixize
-------

unixize is a small tool to bulk rename files into a cool UNIX-friendly
standard. Basically, everything becomes lowercase and there is no need to
escape characters anymore when entering your filenames in a terminal. It
also removes unicode characters.

unixize is configurable through options. Refer to
  $ man unixize
to get a list of options.

Dependencies
------------
- A C compiler
- GNU Make

Installation
------------
You can get unixize either through git or fossil.

For fossil use:
  $ mkdir unixize
  $ cd unixize
  $ fossil clone https://chiselapp.com/user/JozanLeClerc/repository/unixize unixize.fossil
  $ fossil open --force unixize.fossil

or for git:
  $ git clone git://jozanleclerc.xyz/jozan/unixize.git
  $ cd unixize

Then build the program:
  $ make
  $ sudo make install clean

Note that on BSD systems you want to use gmake instead of make:
  $ gmake
  $ sudo gmake install clean

Usage
-----
USE WITH CAUTION!

Without the -p option, unixize will commit to do exactly
what it's supposed to do, rename all the badly formatted in the chosen
directory. To deunixize your files, you'll have to rename everything
manually.

Example of usage:
  $ cd messy_directory
  $ unixize -v -r .

End note
--------
Please note that unixize was tested only on FreeBSD at the moment.
Linux and macOS tests are coming soon.  You can report bug on
[[https://github.com/JozanLeClerc/unixize.git][GitHub]].

Thanks for checking *unixize*.
